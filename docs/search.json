    "title": "Non-gendered shocks, gendered consequences: Evidence from a German reform",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The G8 reform shortened the duration of the high-track high school program in Germany from nine to eight years. Its implementation covered most federal states and followed a staggered schedule. As a result, in the year the G8 system was introduced, two cohorts graduated from high school simultaneously. This reform generated a temporary positive supply shock, particularly in the apprenticeship market. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of this policy on the gender composition of apprenticeship market entrants, focusing on whether the surge in supply led to a crowding-out of female candidates. Using administrative data covering all apprenticeship contracts in Germany, we find that the G8 reform, and the resulting supply shock, reduced the share of new apprenticeship contracts held by women. This effect is persistent, remaining up to three years after the initial shock."
