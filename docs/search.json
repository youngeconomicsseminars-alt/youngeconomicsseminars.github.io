    "title": "The Bank-Sovereign Nexus in a Banking Union: Evidence from Significant and Less Significant Institutions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This paper investigates the impact of the European Banking Union (EBU) on the nexus between the bank and sovereign sectors, focusing on potential implicit government guarantees among Significant Institutions (SIs) and Less Significant Institutions (LSIs). Using an event study approach around key EBU milestones, it shows that the publication of the official list of SIs is the only event with a significant impact on bank stock prices. Newly designated SIs experienced positive abnormal returns, while LSIs showed no significant change—consistent with increased expectations of government support for designated institutions. To distinguish between announcement and implementation effects, the study quantifies the EBU’s long-term impact on the bank–sovereign nexus, measured by the comovement between bank stock returns and domestic sovereign CDS spreads. Using the SI list publication as an exogenous supervisory classification, difference-in-differences and triple-differences estimates reveal a significant reduction in SI banks’ sensitivity relative to LSIs after the reform. However, extending the analysis to include the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a reemergence of the nexus, indicating that systemic tail events may still involve expectations of public intervention."

    "title": "Non-gendered shocks, gendered consequences: Evidence from a German reform",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The G8 reform shortened the duration of the high-track high school program in Germany from nine to eight years. Its implementation covered most federal states and followed a staggered schedule. As a result, in the year the G8 system was introduced, two cohorts graduated from high school simultaneously. This reform generated a temporary positive supply shock, particularly in the apprenticeship market. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of this policy on the gender composition of apprenticeship market entrants, focusing on whether the surge in supply led to a crowding-out of female candidates. Using administrative data covering all apprenticeship contracts in Germany, we find that the G8 reform, and the resulting supply shock, reduced the share of new apprenticeship contracts held by women. This effect is persistent, remaining up to three years after the initial shock."
