Postdoctoral researcher in environmental economics on the MARBFES project. During my PhD thesis I studied how global warming and climate policies affect the economic and environmental performance of firms, applying causal inference methods. Mountain enthusiast, I enjoy climbing and playing board games, but usually not at the same time.
